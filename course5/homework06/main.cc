/***
Please, write a String class.

String is the simplest container; it manages a char buffer.
Use std::unique_ptr<char[]> to manage your buffer.

As before, split your implementation into 3 files, and make sure to test all the methods/operators/constructors. Attempt to automate your tests, ie instead of printing them and require eyeball checking, let the computer do the testing; use asserts.

Implement the following operations:
- Default constructor (ideally, in well behaving container, default constructor is cheap and doesnâ€™t allocate memory)
- Copy constructor and assignment operator. The copy should be deep; make sure it is deep.
- Move constructor and assignment operator.
- Constructor and assignment operator from const char*
- length() method
- operator[], to access individual characters. Both const and non-const version. Test both!
- Operators + and += for concatenation
- c_str() method
- operator<< for stream output.

Use std::string as an inspiration. Ideally, your string should be source-compatible with std::string, ie, replacing your String with std::string should yield the same behavior.
Run your program through valgrind, make sure there is no memory leaks and no errors.
