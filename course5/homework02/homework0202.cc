Write a recursive function that calculates square root using Newtonâ€™s method.
Let the function returns not only the result of the computation, but also some meta data:
- Depth of the recursions
- Enough data that allows you to infer the size of a stack frame of the function. There is several ways of doing it; for instance: you can record the address of some local variable in the function in the first and last call of the function, divided it by (depth-1)

Answer the following:
- which direction does the stack grows?
- what is the impact of compilation mode (debug/release) on the size of the stack frame


Newton's Method, from Wikipedia:
a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
Given a function f and an initial guess x_n at the root, then a better approximation is:
x_{n+1} = x_{n} - f(x_{n}) / f'(x_{n})

So for square roots:
f(x) = x^2
f'(x) = 2x
x_{n+1} = x_{n} - (x_{n}^2 - x_{n}) / (2 * x_{n})

float newton_sqrt(float input, float result)
{
    if (std::abs(result * result - input) > .0001) {
        result = result - (( result * result - input) / (2 * result));
        return newton_sqrt(input, result);
    }
    return result;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    float inputs[22] = {
        FLT_MIN, 0.000234, 0.001, 0.087, 0.5,
        5, 13, 19, 52, 78, 9283657, FLT_MAX,
        0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 400, 1024
    };
    float guess = 90;

    for (auto input : inputs) {
        float newton_result = newton_sqrt(input, guess);
        std::cout << input << ": " << newton_result << " vs " << std::sqrt(input) << std::endl;
    }
